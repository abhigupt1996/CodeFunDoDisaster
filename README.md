Predictive analytics is one of the highlights of machine learning that enables associations to think about the inevitable occasions. Machine learning takes the necessary steps of predictive analytics by following examples and breaking down data to think about the potential outcomes of the disasters in future. Predictive analytics can help authorities by giving them points of interest on the particular regions where they are less influenced. This data encourages concerning sending rescue groups to specific locales and informs authorities by enabling them with data on territories which are less affected by the disaster. Aside from informing fiasco administration groups about territories, predictive analytics can likewise supply experiences for the experts to know the effect of a specific disaster influenced region.
Metrics used for ML model gravity data, ionospheric changes, GPS-derived plate velocities, releases of radon gas etc.
Variation of these parameters over the years to map with the earthquake intensity and magnitude using predictive analysis and ensemble learning. The outliers would finally be mapped with  the lat-logs of the regions affected by the calamity.

Finally automted rescue teams allocated to these regions would be notified along with the intensity and urgency of relieve packages required.
